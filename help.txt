-player1            String      Human               Defines the type of player to represent player 1.
-player2            String      AI(Random,Score)    Defines the type of player to represent player 2.
-useGUI             boolean     true                Toggles the graphical interface on or off.
-showOutput         boolean     false               Tells the program whether or not to display, in the console, the output the AI players produce.
-archiveGame        boolean     true                Determines whether or not the played game is written to an archive file upon completion.
-moveDelay          int         100                 Number of milliseconds to wait before allowing the next player to move. Allows game state to be viewed before it is changed again.
-AIRunTime          int         5000                Number of milliseconds that an AI player is allowed to use to determine the move it wants to play.
-runCount           int         1                   Number of times to repeat the execution of the Othello game.
-boardSize          int         8                   The width and height of the Othello board in board spaces.

-D#             Depth                               MinimaxDeciders                 6           FixedMinimax-D9     The max depth that a Minimax AI will search to. Does not affect games where Minimax deciders are unused.
-R              Random Internal Decider             MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     -           MCTS-R              Applies a RandomDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process.
-FM#            Fixed Minimax Internal Decider      MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     -           MCTS-FM7            Applies a FixedMinimaxDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process. Takes a number to specify the Minimax decider's depth.
-IM#            Iterative Minimax Internal Decider  MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     -           MCTS-IM10           Applies a IterativeMinimaxDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process. Takes a number to specify the Minimax decider's depth.
-S#             Simulation Maximum                  MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     Infinite    MCTS-S25000         Sets the max number of simulations a MCTS AI will carry out before halting. If not specified, no limit will be placed.
