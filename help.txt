Command Line Argument Guide

1. Available Arguments:

Argument Label      Type        Default             Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-player1            String      Human               Defines the type of player to represent player 1. Human players require no extra arguments.
-player2            String      AI(Random,Score)    Defines the type of player to represent player 2. AI players must be given a decider and an evaluator.
-useGUI             boolean     true                Toggles the graphical interface on or off.
-showOutput         boolean     false               Tells the program whether or not to display, in the console, the output the AI players produce.
-archiveGame        boolean     true                Determines whether or not the played game is written to an archive file upon completion.
-alternate          boolean     false               If set to true, will swap which counters the players control in each game. Only affects runs where -runCount is greater then 1.
-moveDelay          int         100                 Number of milliseconds to wait before allowing the next player to move. Allows game state to be viewed before it is changed again.
-AIRunTime          int         5000                Number of milliseconds that an AI player is allowed to use to determine the move it wants to play.
-runCount           int         1                   Number of times to repeat the execution of the Othello game.
-boardSize          int         8                   The width and height of the Othello board in board spaces.


2. Available Deciders and Evaluators:

Decider Name                   Argument            Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RandomDecider                  Random              Uses random selection to determine what moves to play.
FixedMinimaxDecider            FixedMinimax        Searches to a fixed depth and determines what move to play via evaluation of possible moves. Execution can be halted by timeout, resulting in some states not being evaluated.
IterativeMinimaxDecider        IterativeMinimax    Improved Minimaxer that iteratively searched to deeper depths until max is reached. On timeout, will always return a value for each state.
MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider    MCTS                Chooses moves based on simulations of possible futures from the said move. The returned move has the highest predicted victory chance.

Evaluator Name                 Argument            Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ScoreEvaluator                 Score               Evaluates states based on the difference between the two player's scores.
PositionalEvaluator            Positional          Determines the worth of a state based on what counters they own and in what positions they are in.
DeepLearningEvaluator          DeepLearning        Returns the valuation of the game state based on the result of the evaluator's artificial neural network. Must be given the ANN to use as an additional argument.


3. Additional Decider/Evaluator Arguments:

Argument Label  Name                                Used By                         Default                     Example                       Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-D#             Depth                               MinimaxDeciders                 6                           FixedMinimax-D9               The max depth that a Minimax AI will search to. Does not affect games where Minimax deciders are unused.
-R              Random Internal Decider             MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     In Use                      MCTS-R                        Applies a RandomDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process.
-M#             Fixed Minimax Internal Decider      MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     Not in Use                  MCTS-M7                       Applies a FixedMinimaxDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process. Takes a number to specify the Minimax decider's depth (Recommended range for this value is between 4 and 8 inclusively, depending on the power of the computer's CPU).
-S#             Simulation Maximum                  MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     Infinite                    MCTS-S25000                   Sets the max number of simulations a MCTS AI will carry out before halting. If not specified, no limit will be placed.
-P#				Probability of Imperfect Simulation MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     0.10                        MCTS-P0.01                    Specifies the chance that a RandomDecider is used to determine moves in the MCTS simulations instead of the provided decider (see -R and -M args).
-T#				Milliseconds Per Minimax            MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     10                          MCTS-T25                      Sets the time the internal decider can spend deciding a move. Larger times result in more accurate simulations, but less of them.
-F("")			DeepLearning Network Filename		DeepLearningEvaluator			None, path required			DeepLearning-F(ann/net.zip)   Used to specify the file to load the pretrained NN from for the DeepLearningEvaluator. Program will use default path if no path is provided.
