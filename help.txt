Argument Label	Type		Default	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-player1		String		Human				Defines the type of player to represent player 1.
-player2		String		AI(Random,Score)	Defines the type of player to represent player 2.
-useGUI			boolean		true				Toggles the graphical interface on or off.
-showOutput		boolean		false				Tells the program whether or not to display, in the console, the output the AI players produce.
-moveDelay		int			100					Number of milliseconds to wait before allowing the next player to move. Allows game state to be viewed before it is changed again.

-boardSize		int 		8					The width and height of the Othello board in board spaces.


Additional Decider Arguments:	

Argument Label	Name								Used By							Default		Example				Description		
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-D#				Depth								MinimaxDeciders					6			FixedMinimax-D9		The max depth that a Minimax AI will search to. Does not affect games where Minimax deciders are unused.
-R				Random Internal Decider				MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider		-			MCTS-R				Applies a RandomDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process.
-FM#			Fixed Minimax Internal Decider		MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider		-			MCTS-FM7			Applies a FixedMinimaxDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process. Takes a number to specify the Minimax decider's depth.
-IM#			Iterative Minimax Internal Decider	MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider		-			MCTS-IM10			Applies a IterativeMinimaxDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process. Takes a number to specify the Minimax decider's depth.
-S#				Simulation Maximum					MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider		Infinite	MCTS-S25000			Sets the max number of simulations a MCTS AI will carry out before halting. If not specified, no limit will be placed.
