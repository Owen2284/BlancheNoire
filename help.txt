Available arguments:

Argument Label      Type        Default 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-player1            String      Human               Defines the type of player to represent player 1.
-player2            String      AI(Random,Score)    Defines the type of player to represent player 2.
-useGUI             boolean     true                Toggles the graphical interface on or off.
-showOutput         boolean     false               Tells the program whether or not to display, in the console, the output the AI players produce.
-archiveGame        boolean     true                Determines whether or not the played game is written to an archive file upon completion.
-moveDelay          int         100                 Number of milliseconds to wait before allowing the next player to move. Allows game state to be viewed before it is changed again.
-AIRunTime          int         5000                Number of milliseconds that an AI player is allowed to use to determine the move it wants to play.
-runCount           int         1                   Number of times to repeat the execution of the Othello game.
-boardSize          int         8                   The width and height of the Othello board in board spaces.

Argument Label  Name                                Used By                         Default     Example                     Description     
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-D#             Depth                               MinimaxDeciders                 6           FixedMinimax-D9             The max depth that a Minimax AI will search to. Does not affect games where Minimax deciders are unused.
-R              Random Internal Decider             MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     In Use      MCTS-R                      Applies a RandomDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process.
-M#             Fixed Minimax Internal Decider      MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     Not in Use  MCTS-M7                     Applies a FixedMinimaxDecider for a MCTS AI to use for simulating moves during it's decision process. Takes a number to specify the Minimax decider's depth (Recommended range for this value is between 4 and 8 inclusively, depending the power of the computer's CPU).
-S#             Simulation Maximum                  MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     Infinite    MCTS-S25000                 Sets the max number of simulations a MCTS AI will carry out before halting. If not specified, no limit will be placed.      
-P#				Probability of Imperfect Simulation MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     0.10        MCTS-P0.01                  Specifies the chance that a RandomDecider is used to determine moves in the MCTS simulations instead of the provided decider (see -R and -M args).
-T#				Milliseconds Per Minimax            MonteCarloTreeSearchDecider     10          MCTS-T25                    Sets the time the internal decider can spend deciding a move. Larger times result in more accurate simulations, but less of them.
-F("")			DeepLearning Network Filename		DeepLearningEvaluator			-			DeepLearning-F(nn/net.txt)  Used to specify the file to load the pretrained NN from for the DeepLearningEvaluator. Program will use default path if no path is provided.
