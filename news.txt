Games Archive
- Downloaded from http://www.ffothello.org/informatique/la-base-wthor/
- Files in .wtr format, only openable by Win-Test program
- Files no longer supported by any version of the program.
- Found a website that uses the same data to display games: http://www.soongsky.com/en/database/index.php
- Was able to extract the move list and scores from the JavaScript and store them in text files.
- These files can be read into the game and converted into a series of moves, which can be resimulated by the program.
